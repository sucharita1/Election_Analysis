# Election_Analysis
To automate the election audit of tabulated results of US congressional precinct in Colorado using python.

## Overview of Election Audit
Tom is a Colorado board of Elections employee and Seth is his boss. Seth wants us to help Tom automate the election audit process using python. We get the votes from three sources Mail-In ballots, punch cards, Direct recording electronic  or DRE counting machines for a particular county and candidate in [election_results.csv](https://github.com/sucharita1/Election_Analysis/blob/e2f21aa2fc722a4e4baec40cf72c8ad6baafc808/Resources/local_election_results.csv) 


In this project, our final Python script needs to deliver the following information when the script is run and print in on the terminal as well as save in the the file [election_analysis.txt](https://github.com/sucharita1/Election_Analysis/blob/e2f21aa2fc722a4e4baec40cf72c8ad6baafc808/analysis/election_analysis.txt) for certification.

1. Total number of votes cast
2. The voter turnout for each county
3. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
4. The county with the highest turnout
5. Total number of votes each candidate received
6. Percentage of votes each candidate won
7. The winner of the election based on popular vote

We also need to walk an extra mile and show that our code can be generalized and resued for senatorial districts and local elections.

## Resources
* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.8.5, Visual Studio Code, 1.62.2

## Election-Audit Results
The analysis of the election show that:

* There were 369,711 votes cast during the election.

* There were three counties that took part in the election.
    1. Jefferson
    2. Denver
    3. Arapahoe

* The results for each county were:
    1. Jefferson percentage votes was 10.5% of the votes. The number of votes was 38,855.
    2. Denver percentage votes was 82.8% of the votes. The number of votes was 306,055.
    3. Arapahoe percentage votes was 6.7% of the votes. The number of votes was 24,801.

* The county with highest voter turnout was:
    * Denver with 82.8% votes or 306,055 number of votes.

* There were three candidates who took part in the election.
    1. Charles Casper Stockham
    2. Diana DeGette
    3. Raymon Anthony Doane

* The candidate results were:
    1. Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    2. Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    3. Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

* The winner of the election was:
    * Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

The snapshot of the results as generated by the script is shown below:

## Election-Audit Summary

### Why do we need an automatic election audit?
Elections are a prestigious affair and reliabilty and efficiency is paramount in it. Election audits are conducted after every election to ensure that vote count is accurate. For a task that requires efficiency and accuracy at the same time the best solution is automation.

### Why do we need python to conduct an audit?
Currently, audit is being done using excel but it has some shortcomings
    * Delay in audit as each result has to be manually tabulated and then a report has to be manually generated based on the tables generated by excel
    * There may be a possibilty of human error e.g. someone misses a row/column while calculating a formula or making a table.

### PyPoll - Future of election audits

#### Elections can be congressional, senatorial or local etc. There may be many candidates or many counties in a state but the format essentially would be ballot id, county and candidate name for each type of election  or geographical region.

![election_results_format](https://github.com/sucharita1/Election_Analysis/blob/e2f21aa2fc722a4e4baec40cf72c8ad6baafc808/Resources/election_results_format.png?raw=true)

All you need is different csv files for different types of elections saved at a specific location, we can fetch the files give you the results in seconds saved in a txt file for certification as well as printed on a terminal for you to confirm.

There are two methods in which we can create a python script to fulfill the objectives above
    1. Functions: It is the first step towards making a code reusable. The code using functions can be assessed [PyPoll with Functions](https://github.com/sucharita1/Election_Analysis/blob/e2f21aa2fc722a4e4baec40cf72c8ad6baafc808/PyPoll_Challenge_functions.py)
    We can clearly see that there are two major tasks happening in the code
        * Reading the csv file and saving the values like total_votes, candidate_option, candidate_votes etc. 
        Using a function get_results with file to load as a parameter we will read the data and calculate the variables, lists, dictionaries and return them as a list.
        * Formatting the values calculated previosuly and printing it on terminal as well as saving in a text file.
    Using  function save_results with file to save and list returned from get_results we format the values, write the values in txt file as well as print the result on screen.

   Now all we need is a menu that will receive user input as to the type of election we want the results of like congressional/local/senatorial and we can fetch the results easily. A while loop makes it possible to get multiple results in a single session.
   
   ![functions_menu](https://github.com/sucharita1/Election_Analysis/blob/e2f21aa2fc722a4e4baec40cf72c8ad6baafc808/Resources/functions_menu.png?raw=true)
   
   The output of the code will be  
   
   ![functions_output](https://github.com/sucharita1/Election_Analysis/blob/e2f21aa2fc722a4e4baec40cf72c8ad6baafc808/Resources/functions_output.png?raw=true)
        
   2. Classes:  Classes are one of the elegant ways for resuing code. The code using functions can be assessed [PyPoll with Classes](https://github.com/sucharita1/Election_Analysis/blob/e2f21aa2fc722a4e4baec40cf72c8ad6baafc808/PyPoll_Challenge_classes.py)
    * We see that we are dealing with different types of elections but essentially having the same type of attributes and need same operations/methods. So we create an Election class having the attributes like like total_votes, candidate_option, candidate_votes and methods like get_results and save_results.
    * Here, we create different instances of the class like local, comgressional or senatorial to output different election results.

   Now all we need is a menu that will receive user input as to the type of election we want the results of like congressional/local/senatorial and we can fetch the results easily. A while loop makes it possible to get multiple results in a single session.

   The output of the code will be
